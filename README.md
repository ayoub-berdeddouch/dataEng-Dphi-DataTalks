# About the Course


# Overview

Welcome to Data Engineering Bootcamp :) 

We are doing this bootcamp with the support of DataTalks.Club. The content is created by some of the renowned data leaders. Many thanks to DataTalks.Club and the instructors for creating and allowing us to put this bootcamp together. Check them out

* [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/)
* [Alexey Grigorev](https://linkedin.com/in/agrigorev)
* [Ankush Khanna](https://linkedin.com/in/ankushkhanna2)
* [Sejal Vaidya](https://linkedin.com/in/vaidyasejal) 
* [Victoria Perez Mola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriaperezmola/)

In this bootcamp, there will be:

* 6 Weeks of Learning Content - release every Friday ([detailed schedule here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zqCxW8gQ5ZUqDsja_E3ffwtUeE08VXvX9x4qJLNUWSc/edit))
* Home works for practice
* 1 Graded Hands-on Assignment

### Self-paced mode

* All the materials of the course are freely available, so you can take the course at your own pace
* Follow the suggested syllabus (see below) week by week


### Learning Modules:

* Learning modules will be released every Friday, starting from 13th May, 7:00 PM CET/ 10:30 PM IST.
* Please keep checking this space for regular learning module additions we make.
* To accommodate learners from across the globe, we are putting the learning modules in offline format instead of having live sessions. This will allow you to learn at your own time.
* If you face any issues while learning, feel free to drop a message on #help channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/E2XfSEYm2W).

### Assignment Guidelines

* There will be 1 Final Assignment, mandatory to attempt for the bootcamp completion.
* Howeworks are for practice and we recommend you to work on them. However, they don't carry weightage while issuing certificate.
* Certificate: In order to be eligible for the certificate, you should submit the assignment with a total score of minimum 60%.

Happy Learning :)
